    "[Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) is a classic children's game. Two players count down from 3 and simultaneously throw one of three shapes. Each round of the game has only three possible outcomes (summarized in the image below) as well as a tie.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. accepts two variables `player1` and `player2` as inputs\n",
    "2. the only input variables that should work are \"rock\", \"paper\", and \"scissors\n",

    "4. returns a string saying which player won\n",
